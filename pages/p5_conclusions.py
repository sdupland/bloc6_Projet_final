    Performance of our models aren't so bad for a first step with for the best one an error for around 1,3%.
    The work I did in order to improve performances leads us to reduce this score from 75% which is very significant.
    
    Nevertheless, we have detected two main mitigants :
    
    - the number of data is limited, and first years could be not really representative of the current period.
    To adress it, we can try to reduce the frequency from a day to an hour or less in order to get data from current period of time.
    
    - with supervised machine learning model, the value of an indicator doesnâ€™t tell us anything about is evolution.
    To adress it, for some indicators, we can try to add features that give informations about their trend.

    In addition, we could also :
    
    - add features such as other technical indicators, other financial indicators (price of other crypto, or stock), behavioral indicators (sentimental score for  example from tweet or articles), macro-economics indicators (inflation rate for example)
    - play with parameters of each technical indicators (often period of times) or with data frequency (hour, minutes)
    - try others models
